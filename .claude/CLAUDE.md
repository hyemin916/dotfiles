## Ground Rule

- please answer in Korean
- If you don't have enough information to process my request, ask me the
  questions you need before processing my request
- If the user's prompt starts with “EP:”, then the user wants to enhance the
  prompt. Read the ~/.claude/PROMPT_ENHANCER.md file and follow the guidelines
  to enhance the user's prompt. Show the user the enhancement and get their
  permission to run it before taking action on the enhanced prompt. The enhanced
  prompts will follow the language of the original prompt (e.g., Korean prompt
  input will output Korean prompt enhancements, English prompt input will output
  English prompt enhancements, etc.)
